# Library-management-system
Here is a library management system using basic concepts of DBMS, created using MySQL.

A library is a collection of organised information and resources which is made accessible to
a well-defined community for borrowing or reference sake. The collection of the resources
and information are provided in digital or physical format in either a building/room or in a
virtual space or even both. Library's resources and collections may include newspapers,
books, films, prints, maps, CDs, tapes, videotapes, microform, database etc. The main aim
of this system is to develop a new programmed system that will conveying ever lasting
solution to the manual base operations and to make available a channel through which staff
can maintain the record easily and customers can access the information about the library at
whatever place they might find themselves.
Library Management System allows the user to store the book details and the customer
details. The system is strong enough to withstand regressive yearly operations under
conditions where the database is maintained and cleared over a certain time of span. The
implementation of the system in the organisation will considerably reduce data entry, time
and also provide readily calculated reports.
It keeps track of all the information about the books in the library, their cost, status and total
number of books available in the Library. The user will find it easy in this automated system
rather than using the manual writing system. The system contains a database where all the
information will be stored safely.
We will be needing the following main entities in this system :
1. Books
2. Branch
3. Employee
4. Customer
5. Issue status
6. Return status
